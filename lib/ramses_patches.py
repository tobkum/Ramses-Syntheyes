Ramses Ecosystem Runtime Patches
================================

Runtime fixes for the vendored ramses-py SDK (lib/ramses/). The SDK files
themselves are deliberately never edited so they stay cleanly replaceable
from upstream — anything the SDK gets wrong is corrected here at runtime.

Applied at import time:
 - DisableMakedirs / guarded os.makedirs (see below).

Applied by apply():
 - RamDaemonInterface.online: returns False on any error instead of leaking
   KeyError/socket exceptions when the daemon dies mid-reply.

Usage:
    import ramses_patches
    ramses_patches.apply()

Removed, because they are fixed in the vendored SDK as of Ramses-Py 30582ce
(PRs #12/#13):
 - RamMetaDataManager.getMetaData no longer prunes entries for missing files
 - RamMetaDataManager.setFileMetaData refuses to rewrite from an unreadable
   sidecar
 - RamMetaDataManager.getValue/setValue guard a falsy filePath

Those patches replaced the SDK's methods wholesale, so keeping them after the
update would have silently overridden upstream's implementations and masked
any later improvement to them. The behaviour is still covered by tests, which
now assert it of the vendored SDK itself rather than of a patch.

The daemon patch is NOT redundant and stays. Upstream's fix is narrower: it
made __testConnection() tolerate a malformed *reply*, but online() is still a
bare `return self.__testConnection()`, so anything the socket layer raises
(ConnectionResetError and friends from __post) still escapes a call that
exists only to answer "is the daemon there?". Removing this patch was tried
and the test caught it immediately.

    online() is a connectivity probe and callers expect a bool. Upstream now

    online() itself is a bare `return self.__testConnection()` and the socket
    send/recv path underneath can still raise (ConnectionResetError, and
    whatever a daemon dying mid-reply produces). Wrap it so a probe never
    takes down its caller.

# Several Ramses-Py SDK getters (RamItem.previewFolderPath, publishFolderPath,
# stepFolderPath, versionFolderPath, latestPublishedVersion*, ...) create
# directories as a side effect of what's meant to be a read-only path lookup.
# Any UI code that just browses/lists (polling the context header, populating
# the open dialog, probing for a plate) can trigger this and litter the
# project with folders that shouldn't exist yet — the same failure family as
# the stray "(1)" folders. Installed here (rather than in the entry script)
# so every module under lib/ can wrap read-only lookups in
# `with DisableMakedirs():`.
