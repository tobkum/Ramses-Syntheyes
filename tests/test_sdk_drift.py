"""The vendored SDK must not drift, checkable without the studio tree.

`lib/ramses` and `lib/yaml` are copies of `Ramses-Dev/lib`, carried here because
this plugin is installed into the SynthEyes scripts folder where no parent
directory exists. The rule is that they are never edited: fixes go upstream to Ramses-Py,
or into `lib/ramses_patches.py` as a runtime patch.

Nothing enforced that. On 31 Jul 2026 a bump updated two of three copies and
looked like success, because a missed copy is silent by nature.

This compares against `tests/sdk_manifest.json`, committed alongside, so it
needs nothing outside this repo and runs wherever the tests run. Bumping the SDK
means regenerating the manifest in the same commit, which is the point: the bump
becomes one visible line in review instead of dozens of quietly changed vendored
files.

`Ramses-Dev/tests/test_sdk_copies.py` answers the other half -- whether all the
copies agree with each other -- and can only run where the whole tree is
checked out.
